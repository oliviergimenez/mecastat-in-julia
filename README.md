# Fitting mechanistic-statistical models to data in Julia

Here I use [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) to fit models specified as systems of partial differential equations with noisy data (aka mechanistic-statistical models). I've watched some of [these excellent video tutorials](https://julialang.org/learning/notebooks/) to learn how to use `Julia`. I recommend [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the code in the Notebook `fit-diffeq-data.ipynb`. The code and outputs can also be seen at <>.
